## Movement Validation ##
The goal of this sub-project is to try and validate the modeled worm movement by comparing it to real worm behavior.

**Relevant Repositories**
- [SegWorm](https://github.com/openworm/SegWorm) - This repo extracts worm information from a video. This repository is not currently undergoing much development. Any questions on it can be directed to @JimHokanson
- [Movement Validation](https://github.com/MichaelCurrie/movement_validation) - This repo has been started for the explicit purpose of trying to match simulation results with the movement of real worms. It is currently very much a work in progress!
